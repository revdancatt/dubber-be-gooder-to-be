## About

This was a follow up airdrop for owners of Dub Be Good To Me. Again in the post photography area, where we get to explore the idea of mixing AI, photography and generative art together. It's an area that doesn't get much support on fxhash, image composition is seen as a bad thing. But I like coming at it from a photography angle, which I think is slightly different.

Below is the original descriptions.

The Presence captures moments before the collapse, strange memories trapped like ghosts in the desolated landscape. The fragments of a culture once flourished here, a glimpse of The Traveller, now gone; they were here, they were alive. The Presence scans the horizon, scanning for the radio signals, a plea for connection, a plea for understanding. The Seeker yearns for the Traveller, longing to be reunited with their companion once more.

But as the Presence sends the transmissions, doubts creep in. Will they ever be received? Will The Seeker even still be able to reconstruct the message, to understand the love and longing imbued in every transmission?

The Traveller's heart aches with the possibility of being forever lost, of their love and connection being nothing more than a fleeting memory in the endless expanse of the universe, they slip again.

This is an image composition of fragments of unknown places, and sometimes people or things. There are rules behind the composition, for a moment in time they are pinned in place, before melting away to reform.
